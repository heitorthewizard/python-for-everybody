# service oriented approuch
* most non-trivial web applications use services
* they use services from other applications
  * credit card charge
  * hotel reservation systems
* services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make use of
  the service (API)

### Multiple Systems
* initially - two systems cooperate and split the problem
* as the data/service becomes useful multiple applications want to use
  the information / application
