# Web Services
## Application Program Interface (API)
* The API itself is largely abstract in that it specifies an
interface and controls the behavior of the objects specified
in that interface. The Software that provides the functionality
described by a API is said to be an "implementation" of the API.
An API is typically defined in terms of the programming language
used ti build an application.

* Generally it gives you a URL with data to use in your application.

## API Security and Rate Limiting
* The compute resources to run these APIs are not "free"
* The data provided by these APIs is usually valuable
* The data providers might limit the number of requests per day,
  demand an API "key", or even charge for usage
* They might change the rules as things progress...

#### summary
* Service Oriented Architecture - allows an application to be broken
  into parts and distribute across network
* An Application Program Interface (API) is a contract for interaction
* Web Services provide infrastructure for applications cooperating
  (an API) over a network - SOAP and REST are two styles of web services
* XML and JSON are serialization formats
