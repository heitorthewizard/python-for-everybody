# Object Lifecycle
* Objects are created, used and discarded
* We have special blocks of code(methods) that get called
    * At the moment of creating (constructor)
    * At the moment of destruction (destructor)
* Constructors are used a lot
* Destructors are seldom used

###### The primary purpose of constructor is to set up some instance
###### variables to have the proper initial values the object is created
### Constructor
    In OOP, a constructor in a class is special block of statement
    called when a object is created

### Many instances
* We can create lots of objects - the class is the template
  for the object
* We can store each distinct object in its own variable
* We call this having multiple instances of the same class
* Each instance has its own copy of the instance variables
