# Python Objects
    
## Object Oriented
    - A program is made up of many cooperating objects
    - Instead of being the "whole program" - Each object is a little
      "island" within the program and cooperatively working with other
      objects
    - A program is made up of one or more objects working together
      - Objects make use of each other's capabilities

### Object
    - An Object is a bit of self-contained Code and Data
    - A key aspect of an Object is to break a problem into smaller parts
      (divide and conquer)
    - Object has boundaries that allow us to ignore un-need detail

#### Definitions
    - Class - a template - the shape of something - "Dog"
    - Method or Message - A defined capability of a class - bark()
    - Field or Attribute - A bit of data in a class - length
    - Object or Instance - A particular instance of a class - "Scooby-Doo"
    - Constructor - Code that runs when an object is created
    - Inheritance - The ability to extend a class to make a new class
