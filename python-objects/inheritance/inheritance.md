# Inheritance
* When we make a new class - we can reuse an existing class and inherit
  all the capabilities of an existing class and then add our own little
  bit to make our new class
* Another form of store and reuse
* Write once - reuse many times
* The new class (child) has all the capabilities of the old class (parent) -
  and then some more

#### Terminology - Inheritance
    "subclass" are more specialized versions of a class, which inherit
    attributes and behaviors from their parent classes, and can introduce
    their own.
